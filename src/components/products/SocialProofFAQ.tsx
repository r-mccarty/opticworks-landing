    id: 1,
    question: "What's the difference between 35%, 15%, and 5% VLT?",
    answer: "VLT (Visible Light Transmission) indicates how much light passes through the film. 35% allows more light and visibility (recommended for most users and legal in most states), 15% provides moderate darkness with good privacy, and 5% offers maximum privacy and heat rejection but may not be legal in all areas. We include a visual comparison guide with your kit."
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: "Is this really foolproof? What if I mess up?",
    answer: "We designed it to be as easy as possible. The pre-cut film and our revolutionary Door Latch Tool remove 99% of the risk. Plus, our video guide walks you through every step. We also offer our 'Oops Protection'â€”if you damage a film during install, we'll send a replacement for just the shipping & handling fee ($15)."
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: "Will this void my Tesla warranty?",
    answer: "No, cosmetic modifications like window tint do not void your vehicle's warranty. Tesla's warranty covers mechanical and electrical components, not cosmetic modifications. Window tinting is a common and accepted modification."
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: "How long will it last?",
    answer: "CyberShade IRX film is warrantied for life against bubbling, peeling, or fading. Our ceramic technology doesn't degrade like cheaper dyed films, so it will maintain its appearance and performance for the life of your vehicle."
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: "Do you offer kits for the rear windows or other cars?",
    answer: "The rear window kit for the Model Y is coming soon! We're also developing kits for Model 3, Model S, and other popular EVs. Sign up for our newsletter to be notified when new products are available."
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question: "What if I live in an apartment and don't have a garage?",
    answer: "You can install CyberShade IRX in any shaded area - a covered parking garage, under a carport, or even in open shade on a calm day. The key is avoiding direct sunlight and wind. Many customers successfully install in public parking garages."
