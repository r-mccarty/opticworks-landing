# Architectural Decision: E-commerce Checkout Flow

## Executive Summary (TL;DR)

This document outlines two primary architectures for building a custom, on-site e-commerce checkout using Stripe Elements.

*   **Option A: The Orchestrator Model** uses the primitive `PaymentIntents` API. Your backend acts as the central orchestrator, manually calling best-in-class APIs for each step: EasyPost for address validation and shipping rates, and the Stripe Tax API for tax calculations.
*   **Option B: The Integrated Model** uses the modern `Checkout Sessions` API with `ui_mode: 'custom'`. Your backend delegates the complex state management of the checkout to Stripe's engine, while still rendering a custom UI with Stripe Elements and using webhooks to inject dynamic shipping rates from EasyPost.

**Recommendation:** For the vast majority of e-commerce businesses, **Option B is the superior choice.** It dramatically reduces development complexity, improves the user experience with a faster, single-page flow, and is more maintainable and future-proof. Option A should only be considered by logistics-heavy businesses where pre-payment, CASS-certified address validation is a strict, mission-critical requirement and the engineering resources are available to manage the added complexity.

## Option A: The Orchestrator Model

### High-Level Approach

Your backend is the "brain" of the checkout. It dictates the entire flow, step-by-step. It fetches data from specialized APIs (EasyPost for logistics, Stripe for tax/payments) and manually synthesizes the final state before charging the user. This is a modular, best-of-breed approach where you own the integration logic.

### Benefits
*   **Unmatched Data Quality:** You can perform CASS-certified address validation with EasyPost *before* calculating shipping or taking payment. This is the gold standard for reducing failed deliveries and fulfillment errors.
*   **Total Process Control:** You have granular, step-by-step control over the entire checkout journey. This is useful for highly complex or unconventional fulfillment logic.
*   **Decoupled Services:** Your services are loosely coupled. You could theoretically swap out Stripe Tax for another tax provider with minimal architectural change.

### Tradeoffs
*   **High Development Complexity:** You are responsible for building and maintaining a complex, multi-step state machine. This includes multiple chained API calls, error handling for each step, and managing the checkout state on your server.
*   **Slower User Experience:** The multi-step nature (Address -> Shipping -> Payment) often requires multiple "loading" states and spinners, which can increase friction and cart abandonment.
*   **High Maintenance Overhead:** As APIs change or regulations evolve, you are responsible for updating the entire orchestration logic. You own every piece of the puzzle.

### Implementation Details

This is a stateful, multi-step flow.

**1. Step 1: Address Collection & Validation (UI -> Backend)**
   *   **Front-End:** User fills out regular HTML input fields for their shipping address. On completion, it calls your backend.
   *   **Backend (`POST /api/validate-and-rate`):**
     1.  Receives the raw address.
     2.  Calls **EasyPost Address Verification API** to get a normalized, CASS-certified address.
     3.  Calls **EasyPost Rating API** with the validated address to get a list of shipping rates.
     4.  Responds with the validated address and the list of rates.

**2. Step 2: Tax Calculation (UI -> Backend)**
   *   **Front-End:** User confirms the validated address and selects a shipping rate. This triggers another API call.
   *   **Backend (`POST /api/calculate-totals`):**
     1.  Receives cart items, validated address, and chosen shipping rate.
     2.  Calls **Stripe Tax Calculations API** (`stripe.tax.calculations.create`) with all the data.
     3.  Calculates the final total (subtotal + shipping + tax).
     4.  Responds with the final breakdown and total.

**3. Step 3: Payment (UI -> Backend -> Stripe)**
   *   **Front-End:** Displays the final, locked-in order summary. User is ready to pay.
   *   **Backend (`POST /api/create-payment-intent`):**
     1.  Receives the final total.
     2.  Calls `stripe.paymentIntents.create({ amount: finalTotal, ... })`.
     3.  Responds with the `clientSecret`.
   *   **Front-End:** Renders `<PaymentElement />` and confirms the payment using `stripe.confirmPayment()`.

**4. Step 4: Fulfillment (Webhook)**
   *   **Backend (`POST /api/webhook`):**
     1.  Handles `payment_intent.succeeded` event.
     2.  Calls `stripe.tax.transactions.createFromCalculation` to finalize the tax record.
     3.  Calls **EasyPost Shipment API** to purchase the shipping label.
     4.  Sends confirmation email.

## Option B: The Integrated Model

### High-Level Approach

You delegate the orchestration of the checkout to Stripe's powerful Checkout Session engine. You still build a fully custom, on-site UI with Stripe Elements, but Stripe manages the complex real-time state changes (like tax recalculation). You use webhooks as a clean mechanism to inject the data that Stripe can't know on its own (your third-party shipping rates).

### Benefits
*   **Reduced Complexity:** This is the biggest win. Stripe handles the entire state machine. Recalculating totals when an address changes or a coupon is applied "just works" without any backend calls from you.
*   **Faster & Smoother UX:** The single-page checkout flow is a proven, high-conversion pattern. The user experience is seamless as elements update instantly without full page reloads or multiple server hops.
*   **Future-Proof & Compliant:** Stripe is responsible for keeping the checkout flow compliant with global regulations (SCA, 3D Secure, etc.). You get new features and compliance updates with minimal effort.
*   **Faster Time to Market:** The dramatic reduction in backend logic and state management means you can build and launch a feature-rich checkout much more quickly.

### Tradeoffs
*   **No Pre-Payment Deliverability Validation:** You can only validate the address *format* with the `<AddressElement />`. You cannot perform a CASS-certified deliverability check before payment. You must handle the small percentage of undeliverable addresses post-payment.
*   **Less Granular Control:** You are operating within the framework and logic of the Checkout Session. While highly flexible, it is more "opinionated" than the PaymentIntents API.
*   **Reliance on Webhooks for Core Flow:** The dynamic shipping rate calculation relies on a webhook flow, which introduces asynchronous logic into the checkout process.

### Implementation Details

This is a state-managed, single-page flow.

**1. Step 1: Session Creation (UI -> Backend)**
   *   **Front-End:** User lands on the checkout page. The app immediately calls your backend to initialize the checkout.
   *   **Backend (`POST /api/create-checkout-session`):**
     1.  Receives cart items.
     2.  Calls `stripe.checkout.sessions.create({ ... })` with:
        *   `ui_mode: 'custom'`
        *   `line_items`
        *   `automatic_tax: { enabled: true }`
        *   `shipping_address_collection: { allowed_countries: [...] }`
        *   `allow_promotion_codes: true` (and other features)
     3.  Responds with the `clientSecret` from the session object.

**2. Step 2: Rendering the UI (Front-End)**
   *   **Front-End:**
     1.  Initializes Stripe with `stripe.initCheckout({ clientSecret })`.
     2.  Renders the required components:
        *   `<AddressElement options={{ mode: 'shipping' }} />`
        *   `<PaymentElement />`
     3.  As the user fills out the `<AddressElement />`, it automatically syncs with Stripe's backend, which calculates tax and updates the total displayed in the `<PaymentElement />` in real-time.

**3. Step 3 (Optional): Dynamic Shipping Rates (Stripe -> Webhook -> Backend -> Stripe)**
   *   **Stripe Event:** When the user has filled in enough of the address, Stripe's backend can be configured to fire a webhook.
   *   **Backend (`POST /api/shipping-rates-webhook`):**
     1.  Receives the webhook with the Session ID and the shipping address.
     2.  Calls **EasyPost Rating API** to get shipping rates.
     3.  Calls `stripe.checkout.sessions.update(sessionId, { shipping_options: [...] })` to inject the rates back into the session.
   *   **Front-End:** Stripe's Elements automatically update to show the shipping options to the user.

**4. Step 4: Payment (Front-End -> Stripe)**
   *   **Front-End:** User clicks "Pay".
     1.  The `handleSubmit` function calls `stripe.submit()`. This finalizes the session and confirms the payment.
     2.  Stripe handles any necessary redirects (e.g., for 3D Secure) and then redirects the user to your configured `success_url`.

**5. Step 5: Fulfillment (Webhook)**
   *   **Backend (`POST /api/webhook`):**
     1.  Handles `checkout.session.completed` event. The event payload contains all the final data, including the customer, shipping address, and line items.
     2.  Calls **EasyPost Shipment API** to purchase the shipping label.
     3.  Sends confirmation email.
